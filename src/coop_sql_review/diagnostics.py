"""Diagnostics — problems the tool hit while *processing* SQL, as opposed to
:class:`Finding`s (which are deviations from the standards).

These exist so nothing fails silently: a file that won't parse, a statement
sqlglot can only treat as an opaque command (so some rules can't see inside
it), or a rule that raised — each becomes a Diagnostic the user can see in
both the console report and the JSON, and can write to a log with
``--log-file``, so the gap can be understood and fixed.

Severity:
- error   : a rule crashed, or a file could not be read (a real bug / blocker)
- warning : analysis was degraded (a batch didn't parse, or parsed opaquely)
            — findings in that region may be incomplete
